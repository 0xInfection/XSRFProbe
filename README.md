### About:
__XSRFProbe__ is an advanced [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)) (CSRF/XSRF) Audit and Exploitation Toolkit. Equipped with a Powerful Crawling Engine and Numerous Systematic Checks, it is now able to detect most cases of CSRF vulnerabilities, their related bypasses and futher generate (maliciously) exploitable proof of concepts with each found vulnerability. For more info on how XSRFProbe works, see [XSRFProbe Internals](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki#xsrfprobe-internals) on [wiki](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/).

### Some Features:

- [x] Performs [several types of checks](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/XSRFProbe-Internals#types-of-checks) before declaring an endpoint as vulnerable.
- [x] Can detect several types of Anti-CSRF tokens in POST requests.
- [x] Works with a powerful crawler which features continuous crawling and scanning.
- [x] Out of the box support for custom cookie values and generic headers.
- [x] Accurate [Token-Strength Detection](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/XSRFProbe-Internals#token-randomness-calculation) and [Analysis](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/XSRFProbe-Internals#post-scan-token-analysis) using various algorithms.
- [x] Can generate both normal as well as maliciously exploitable CSRF proof of concepts.
- [x] Well [documented code](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/tree/master?files=1) and [highly generalised automated workflow](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki#xsrfprobe-internals).
- [x] The user is in [control of everything](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/Advanced-Usage#xsrfprobe-configuration-variables) whatever the scanner does.
- [x] Has a user-friendly interaction environment with full verbose support.
- [x] Detailed logging system of errors, vulnerabilities, tokens and other stuffs.

### Usage:
> For the full usage info, please take a look at the wiki's &mdash; [General Usage](https://github.com/0xinfection/xsrfprobe/wiki/general-usage) and [Advanced Usage](https://github.com/0xinfection/xsrfprobe/wiki/advanced-usage).
- For the basics, the first step is to install the tool:
```
python3 setup.py install
```
- Now, the tool can be fired up via:
```
xsrfprobe --help
```
- After testing XSRFProbe on a site, an output folder is created in your present working directory as `xsrfprobe-output`. Under this folder you can view the detailed logs and information collected during the scans.

### Version and License:
XSRFProbe `v2.1` release is a `Stage 5 Production-Ready (Stable)` release and the work is licensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

### Warnings:

Do not use this tool on a live site!

It is because this tool is designed to perform all kinds of form submissions automatically which can sabotage the site. Sometimes you may screw up the database and most probably perform a DoS on the site as well.

Test on a disposable/dummy setup/site!

### Author's Words:
This project is based __entirely upon my own research and my own experience with web applications__ on Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. You can try going through the source code which is highly documented to help you understand how this toolkit was built. Useful [pull requests](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/Contributing), [ideas and issues](https://github.com/0xInfection/XSRFProbe/wiki/Reporting-Bugs#before-submitting) are highly welcome.
