# this module holds values for controlling the entire scan interface.

# Lets assign some global variables...

# This is standard User-Agent emulating Chrome 68 on Windows 10

# Cookie value to be sent alongwith the requests. This option is particularly
# needed for a wholesome check on CSRFs. Since for a basic successful CSRF attack
# one needs to have a site with long-duration persistent session cookies and no
# Referer validation.
#
# Also you might want to keep this value to '' untill you want to scan your
# web application as a authorised user/admin with elevated priviledges,
# which might give XSRFProbe a wider scope to scan. This is typically
# recommended for websites which has logins/sessions feature. (eg. Social
# Networking Sites, E-Commerce Sites).

# NOTE: If this value is not supplied, XSRFProbe will only scan for simple
# cookies which the tool might encounter while making requests, especially
# POST requests.
